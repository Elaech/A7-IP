The structure of the repository will be composed of three branches.
The hierachy is : master->QA->Develop(Front-End&Back-End).
The workflow will tend to be the following:
1.The Front-End and Back-End will work on a new version in their respective branch, other than the live version that resides within the master brach.
2.After deciding that the work stage is complete they can decide together to release the project to the QA branch for testing.
3.After examining the new version the QA can either decide to release it as the live version, send it to the master brach, or talk with the Front-End and/or Back-End to update or repair the product in order to be re-tested.
4.After an update/a new version goes live, the PM & HR will update the presentation website and project documentation accordingly.
